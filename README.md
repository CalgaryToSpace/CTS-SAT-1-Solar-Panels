# CTS-SAT-1-Solar-Panels
Solar panel PCB designs for the CTS-SAT-1 3U cubesat

## Overview
* 4x COTS 2U solar panels are the main power generation for the satellite.
* As a proof of concept, the following panels are manufactured from TrisolX cells.
    * 2x 1.25U panels
    * 1x 1.0U panel
* Each panel has backflow blocking diodes and shadow-protection diodes.

## 1.25U Solar Panel

* 30 cells, in a 3S10P configuration (3 cells in each string).
