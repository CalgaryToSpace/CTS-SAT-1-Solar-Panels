# CTS-SAT-1-Solar-Panels
Solar panel PCB designs for the CTS-SAT-1 3U cubesat

## Overview
* Several difference designs for each face:
    * 1x 2U face, leaving room for deployable booms
    * 2x 3U faces, with holes for fine star tracker
    * 1x 3U face, with no additional holes
* 40mm x 80mm GaAs solar cells are to be epoxied to large pads on an FR4 PCB. This is the simplest possible design.
* Each panel has backflow blocking diodes and shadow-protection diodes.

## Specific Notes and Specs
* Coarse star tracker requires a place to epoxy to the panels with a 4.5mm x 10mm rectangle (silk screen box).
* TBC: 4-Layer Circuit Board: back side must be all GND so that it does not short out with the frame.
